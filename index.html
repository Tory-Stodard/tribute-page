          Sir Theodorius Maximus, or Theo for short, was the fastest weiner
          alive. The legend goes that he could outrun a cheteah without even
          trying.

        <li class="margin-bottom">
          Just his bark alone were scare off any predators in the nearby area.
          He was feared by all. And for good reason. It was said the he could
          rip up a chew toy in as little as 5 minutes. His mamma stoped buying
          him chew toys because they wouldn't last enough.
        </li>
        <li class="margin-bottom">
          Despite his fearsome attitude, he was always professional. He was
          never seen without his tie.

          How did he save a million lives you might ask? There once was an evil
          rooster that lived down the road. The rooster was know to too
          terrorize the neightboord by waking everyone up with his
          cockadoodledoo's every morning. Sir Theodorius Maximus put an end to
          it... by barking at him.
